<p>This is a first pass at generating responsive wireframes from simple <strong>markdown</strong> files. I love creating notes in <strong>markdown</strong> and creating an outline of content for a page in a text file is standard procedure. It is simple matter to convert <strong>markdown</strong> to <strong>HTML</strong> so <em>why not include some blocks to show basic page layout</em> and have it be responsive.</p>
<p>With this short python script and CSS file, you can convert a folder of markdown files into HTML files blocks or rows of blocks that are in a column on mobile.</p>
