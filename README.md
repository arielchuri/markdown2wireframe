This is a first pass at generating responsive wireframes from simple **markdown** files. I love creating notes in **markdown** and creating an outline of content for a page in a text file is standard procedure. It is simple matter to convert **markdown** to **HTML** so *why not include some blocks to show basic page layout* and have it be responsive.

With this short python script and CSS file, you can convert a folder of markdown files into HTML files blocks or rows of blocks that are in a column on mobile.

It was created from this [markdown file](index.md)
